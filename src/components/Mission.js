        <p>In my opinion, it is extremely important that we continue our journey of reforming and improving our electoral system. Electoral process is the key instrument in continuation of democracy, as transparent and high quality elections give credibility and strength to a democratic system. My vision is to make ECP more vibrant and progressive election management body that delivers its constitutional mandate of organizing and conducting elections honestly, justly, fairly and guarding against corrupt practices, having complete trust of the people and contributing towards a stronger democracy in Pakistan. The uphill task of conducting credible elections can only be attained by adhering highest level of transparency and use of state-of-the-art technologies.</p>
